# renderdoc_ac_importer
Assetto Corsa decryptor using Render Doc

Currently built using Render Doc 1.19. Will only work with captures from this version. Due to changes in how blender handles third part libraries, the latest version of blender currently supported is 3.6.5.

This is fairly outdated. Work should be done for use in Blender 4+ and RDC should be updated past 1.39v
